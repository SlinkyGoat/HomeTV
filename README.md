# HomeTV
A personal project to utilize my otherwise unused TV in my room. The goal is to automatically turn on/off at determined times throughout the day to show various bits of data such as the weather, time, traffic data, a todo list, etc. Additionally, I plan to be able to control it directly from my phone. Everything will be ran on a raspberry pi
